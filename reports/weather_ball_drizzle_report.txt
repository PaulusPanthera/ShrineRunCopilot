DEPRECATED: patch notes live in /REPORT.md (kept for archive)

Weather Ball under Drizzle (Politoed)

Current state:
- Weather Ball is defined as Normal / 50 BP in data/moves.json.
- The tool currently does NOT model weather-based type/power changes for Weather Ball.

Desired behavior (next logic patch):
- If attacker ability is Drizzle (or active weather is Rain), Weather Ball should:
  - become Water-type
  - become 100 base power (Gen 5 weather boost)

Scope note:
- Apply only to Weather Ball; do not change other moves.
- If future weather systems are added, route through a central "active weather" state.
